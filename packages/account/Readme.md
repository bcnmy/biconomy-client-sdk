## Introduction

The Biconomy SDK is your all-in-one toolkit for building decentralized applications (dApps) with **ERC4337 Account Abstraction** and **Smart Accounts**. This SDK is designed for seamless user experiences and offers non-custodial solutions for user onboarding, transaction management, and gas abstraction.

## üåü Features

- **ERC4337 Account Abstraction**: Simplify user operations and gas payments.
- **Smart Accounts**: Enhance user experience with modular smart accounts.
- **Paymaster Service**: Enable third-party gas sponsorship.
- **Bundler Infrastructure**: Ensure efficient and reliable transaction bundling.
- **Backend Node**: Manage chain configurations and gas estimations.

## üì¶ Packages

### Account

Unlock the full potential of **ERC4337 Account Abstraction** with methods that simplify the creation and dispatch of UserOperations, streamlining dApp development and management.

```javascript

import { createSmartAccountClient } from "@biconomy/account";
import { createWalletClient, http } from "viem";
import { privateKeyToAccount } from "viem/accounts";
import { polygonMumbai } from "viem/chains";

const account = privateKeyToAccount(config.privateKey as Hex);
const signer = createWalletClient({
  account,
  chain: polygonMumbai,
  transport: http(),
});

const bundlerUrl = 'https://bundler.biconomy.io/api/v2/80001/<API_KEY>'
// Please go to https://dashboard.biconomy.io and generate bundler url

const biconomySmartAccount = await createSmartAccountClient({ bundlerUrl, signer });
console.log("address: ", await biconomySmartAccount.getAccountAddress());
```

### Paymaster

Acting as third-party intermediaries, Paymasters have the capability to sponsor gas fees for an account, provided specific predefined conditions are met. Additionally, they can accept gas payments in ERC20 tokens from users' smart accounts, with the Paymaster managing the conversion to native tokens for gas payment.

```javascript
import { Paymaster, IPaymaster } from "@biconomy/account";
const paymasterUrl = "";
// Please go to https://dashboard.biconomy.io to setup a paymasterUrl
// ...
const biconomySmartAccount = await createSmartAccountClient({ bundlerUrl, signer, paymasterUrl });
```

# installation

Using `npm` package manager

```bash
npm i @biconomy/account
```

OR

Using `yarn` package manager

```bash
yarn add @biconomy/account
```

### Account

Integrating and deploying Smart Accounts, building and sending user operations is a key offering of any toolkit designed for ERC4337. This package seamlessly integrates the essential features associated with ERC-4337 and simplifies the development of your Dapp's account and transaction rails with added usability features.

The account package achieves this by providing a comprehensive set of methods that enable developers to effortlessly create UserOperations. Combined with the sophisticated, developer friendly and scalable infrastructure of Biconomy, it ensures efficient and reliable transmission of these operations across multiple EVM chains.

## Smart Account instance configuration

#### BiconomySmartAccount (V2 Smart Account)

| Key                     | Description                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| signer                  | This signer will be used for signing userOps for any transactions you build. You can supply your your EOA wallet signer |
| biconomyPaymasterApiKey | You can pass in a paymaster url necessary for sponsoring transactions (retrieved from the biconomy dashboard)           |
|                         | Note: If you don't pass the paymaster instance, your smart account will need funds to pay for transaction fees.         |
| bundlerUrl              | You can pass in a bundlerUrl (retrieved from the biconomy dashboard) for sending transactions                           |

## Example Usage

```typescript
// This is how you create a smartAccount in your dapp
import { Bundler, createSmartAccountClient } from "@biconomy/account";
import { createWalletClient, http, createPublicClient } from "viem";
import { privateKeyToAccount, generatePrivateKey } from "viem/accounts";
import { mainnet as chain } from "viem/chains";

const account = privateKeyToAccount(generatePrivateKey());
const signer = createWalletClient({ account, chain, transport: http() });
const smartAccount = await createSmartAccountClient({ signer, bundlerUrl, biconomyPaymasterApiKey });

// Send some ETH
const { waitForTxHash } = await smartAccount.sendTransaction({ to: "0x...", value: 1 });
const {
  receipt: { transactionHash },
} = await waitForTxHash();
```
