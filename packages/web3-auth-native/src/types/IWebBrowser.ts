   *
   * # On Android:
   * This will be done using a "custom Chrome tabs" browser, [AppState](../react-native/appstate/),
   * and [Linking](./linking/) APIs.
   *
   * # On web:
   * > This API can only be used in a secure environment (`https`). You can use expo `start:web --https`
   * to test this. Otherwise, an error with code [`ERR_WEB_BROWSER_CRYPTO`](#errwebbrowsercrypto) will be thrown.
   * This will use the browser's [`window.open()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/open) API.
   * - _Desktop_: This will create a new web popup window in the browser that can be closed later using `WebBrowser.maybeCompleteAuthSession()`.
   * - _Mobile_: This will open a new tab in the browser which can be closed using `WebBrowser.maybeCompleteAuthSession()`.
   *
   * How this works on web:
   * - A crypto state will be created for verifying the redirect.
   *   - This means you need to run with `expo start:web --https`
   * - The state will be added to the window's `localstorage`. This ensures that auth cannot complete
   *   unless it's done from a page running with the same origin as it was started.
   *   Ex: if `openAuthSessionAsync` is invoked on `https://localhost:19006`, then `maybeCompleteAuthSession`
   *   must be invoked on a page hosted from the origin `https://localhost:19006`. Using a different
   *   website, or even a different host like `https://128.0.0.*:19006` for example will not work.
   * - A timer will be started to check for every 1000 milliseconds (1 second) to detect if the window
   *   has been closed by the user. If this happens then a promise will resolve with `{ type: 'dismiss' }`.
   *
   * > On mobile web, Chrome and Safari will block any call to [`window.open()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/open)
   * which takes too long to fire after a user interaction. This method must be invoked immediately
   * after a user interaction. If the event is blocked, an error with code [`ERR_WEB_BROWSER_BLOCKED`](#errwebbrowserblocked) will be thrown.
   *
   * @param url The url to open in the web browser. This should be a login page.
   * @param redirectUrl _Optional_ - The url to deep link back into your app. By default, this will be [`Constants.linkingUrl`](./constants/#expoconstantslinkinguri).
   * @param browserParams _Optional_ - An object with the same keys as [`WebBrowserOpenOptions`](#webbrowseropenoptions).
   * If there is no native AuthSession implementation available (which is the case on Android)
   * these params will be used in the browser polyfill. If there is a native AuthSession implementation,
   * these params will be ignored.
   *
   * @return
   * - If the user does not permit the application to authenticate with the given url, the Promise fulfills with `{ type: 'cancel' }` object.
   * - If the user closed the web browser, the Promise fulfills with `{ type: 'cancel' }` object.
   * - If the browser is closed using [`dismissBrowser`](#webbrowserdismissbrowser),
   * the Promise fulfills with `{ type: 'dismiss' }` object.

   * - `Cannot use expo-web-browser in a non-browser environment`: If the code was executed in an SSR
   *   or node environment.
   * - `No auth session is currently in progress`: (the cached state wasn't found in local storage).
   *   This can happen if the window redirects to an origin (website) that is different to the initial
   *   website origin. If this happens in development, it may be because the auth started on localhost
   *   and finished on your computer port (Ex: `128.0.0.*`). This is controlled by the `redirectUrl`
   *   and `returnUrl`.
   * - `Current URL "<URL>" and original redirect URL "<URL>" do not match`: This can occur when the
   *   redirect URL doesn't match what was initial defined as the `returnUrl`. You can skip this test
   *   in development by passing `{ skipRedirectCheck: true }` to the function.
   *
   * If `type` is set to `success`, the parent window will attempt to close the child window immediately.
   *
   * If the error `ERR_WEB_BROWSER_REDIRECT` was thrown, it may mean that the parent window was
   * reloaded before the auth was completed. In this case you'll need to close the child window manually.
