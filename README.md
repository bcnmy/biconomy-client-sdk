## Introduction

The Biconomy SDK is your all-in-one toolkit for building decentralized applications (dApps) with **ERC4337 Account Abstraction** and **Smart Accounts**. This SDK is designed for seamless user experiences and offers non-custodial solutions for **ERC6900 compliant** user onboarding, transaction management, and gas abstraction.

## üåü Features

- **ERC4337 Account Abstraction**: Simplify user operations and gas payments.
- **Smart Accounts**: Enhance user experience with ERC6900 compliant accounts.
- **Paymaster Service**: Enable third-party gas sponsorship.
- **Bundler Infrastructure**: Ensure efficient and reliable transaction bundling.
- **Backend Node**: Manage chain configurations and gas estimations.

## üì¶ Packages

### Account

Unlock the full potential of **ERC4337 Account Abstraction** with methods that simplify the creation and dispatch of UserOperations, streamlining dApp development and management.

```javascript
const biconomyAccount = new BiconomySmartAccount(biconomySmartAccountConfig);
const biconomySmartAccount = await biconomyAccount.init();
console.log("owner: ", biconomySmartAccount.owner);
console.log("address: ", biconomySmartAccount.address);
```

### Bundler

Leverage standardized bundler infrastructure for efficient operation of account abstraction across EVM networks.

```javascript
const bundler: IBundler = new Bundler({
    bundlerUrl: '', // From Biconomy Dashboard
    chainId: ChainId.POLYGON_MUMBAI,
    entryPointAddress: DEFAULT_ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS,
});
```

### Paymaster

Acting as third-party intermediaries, Paymasters have the capability to sponsor gas fees for an account, provided specific predefined conditions are met. Additionally, they can accept gas payments in ERC20 tokens from users' smart accounts, with the Paymaster managing the conversion to native tokens for gas payment.

```javascript
const paymaster: IPaymaster = new BiconomyPaymaster({
    paymasterUrl: '' // From Biconomy Dashboard
});
```
