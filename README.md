- **Bundler Infrastructure**: Ensure efficient and reliable transaction bundling.
- **Backend Node**: Manage chain configurations and gas estimations.

## 📦 Packages

### Account

Unlock the full potential of **ERC4337 Account Abstraction** with methods that simplify the creation and dispatch of UserOperations, streamlining dApp development and management.

### Bundler

Leverage standardized bundler infrastructure for efficient operation of account abstraction across EVM networks.

### Paymaster

Acting as third-party intermediaries, Paymasters have the capability to sponsor gas fees for an account, provided specific predefined conditions are met. Additionally, they can accept gas payments in ERC20 tokens from users' smart accounts, with the Paymaster managing the conversion to native tokens for gas payment.
