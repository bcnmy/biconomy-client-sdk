# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The safety and security of our smart contract platform is our top priority. If you have discovered a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us responsibly.

### Contact Us Directly for Critical or High-Risk Findings

For critical or high-impact vulnerabilities that could affect our users, **please contact us directly** at:

- Email: security@biconomy.io

We'll work with you to assess and understand the scope of the issue.

### For Other Issues

For vulnerabilities that are less critical and do not immediately affect our users:

1. Open an issue in our GitHub repository (`https://github.com/bcnmy/biconomy-client-sdk/issues`).

2. Provide detailed information about the issue and steps to reproduce.

If your findings are eligible for a bounty, we will follow up with you on the payment process.

### Scope

The bounty program covers code in the `main` branch of our repository. The vulnerability must not have already been addressed or fixed in the `develop` branch.

### Eligibility

To be eligible for a bounty, researchers must:

- Report a security bug that has not been previously reported.

- Not violate our testing policies (detailed below).

- Follow responsible disclosure guidelines.

### Testing Policies

- Do not conduct testing on the mainnet or public testnets. Local forks should be used for testing.

- Avoid testing that generates significant traffic or could lead to denial of service.

- Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had the chance to address it.

### Out of Scope

- Known issues listed in the issue tracker or already fixed in the `develop` branch.

- Issues in third-party components.

## Legal Notice

By submitting a vulnerability report, you agree to comply with our responsible disclosure process. Public disclosure of the vulnerability without consent from us will render the vulnerability ineligible for a bounty.

Thank you for helping to keep Biconomy üçä and the blockchain community safe!
